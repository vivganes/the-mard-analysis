You must have seen feminists (smugly) quoting a Times of India article titled "Women misusing domestic violence law? Data tells a very different story" 

![News clip](/assets/images/blogs/throw-data-dv/news-clip.png)

Let's break it down, revisit their data points and see what story their data REALLY says.

## Data Points Debunked

### Data Point #1

They claim "According to the UN report on femicides (2024), the home is the most dangerous place for women globally as 60% of women who were killed by men died at the hands of a partner or family member."

#### Response

The source for the UN report on femicides is [this site](https://dataunodc.un.org/dp-intentional-homicide-victims){:target="_blank"}.

Interestingly, in the countries list, there is no "India". when we search for intimate partner killings  (See screenshot üëá)

![No India data](/assets/images/blogs/wolf-lamb-weapon/no-india-data.png)

They have NO data from India.  However, our honourable authors misrepresent it as if the data is applicable to India.

Desperate, much?

### Data Point #2

They claim "According to NCRB data from six years (2017 to 2022), more women (25,197) than men (21,579) have died by suicide due to marriage-related issues"

#### Response 

Where do I start? üòÖ

 a. The data is imagined. Note the interchanged digits in the numbers?

 b. The actual data looks like this üëá (Source: [NCRB](https://ncrb.gov.in/adsi-all-previous-publications.html){:target="_blank"} )

 ![Data from 2017-2022](/assets/images/blogs/throw-data-dv/data-2017-22.png)

 c. One should not just see "Marriage-related" causes when dealing with men.  Family problems also probably have something to do with the wife. [We are not in joint families anymore, right?]

 d. Even if we graciously imagine their data point to be true, 21579 men have died due to marriage-related issues.  What has the system done to reduce it? 

 e. By claiming more women die than men, the authors have created **deeply reductionist ‚Äòmen vs women‚Äô debates** themselves, which they seem to hate. 
Hypocrisy, much?

### Data Point #3

They claim "It is family problems (not related to marriage) that constitute the biggest cause of suicide for men in India, for the period of 2017 to 2022, forming 30.8% of total suicides by men as compared to marriage-related issues (3.4%)."

#### Response
 a. Family problems are not related to marriage? I have read that women are from Venus.  Maybe these two women really are.

 b. I don't have the motivation to check their numbers, going by their track record of fudging numbers with just digits interchanged.

### Data Point #4

They claim "52.5% of all female suicide victims in India in 2022 were housewives."

#### Response 
 a. Housewives amount to 14.8% of the total suicide victims in 2022.  Just to bloat the number, the authors counted only among women.

 b. 14.8% is still a significant number. If their argument was that housewives need to be provided special care, it is acceptable.  Their argument does not look like that though üòï

 c. As per the same logic, men make up 71.8% of all suicides.  What special care do we need for these men? (Source: [NCRB](https://ncrb.gov.in/uploads/nationalcrimerecordsbureau/custom/1702020526Table26allindia.pdf){:target="_blank"}) - See pic also üëá

### Data Point #5

They claim "Data from NCRB shows that the number of cases filed under the IPC Section 498A and the Dowry Prohibition Act, 1961, increased by 33.9% and 32.3% respectively, from 2017 to 2022."

#### Response
a. How many of them got into conviction?  Remember 'innocent unless proven guilty'?

b. While they are complaining about under-reporting, the reporting numbers seem to have increased. If this does not make them happy, what else will? ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è

### Data Point #6

They claim "Anticipatory bail was granted in 72.5% of cases filed ... "

#### Response

The court does not provide AB without satisfying itself about the need for arrest. This statement of the authors borders on contempt of court(s).

### Data Point #7

They claim "According to the National Family Health Survey (NFHS) 5, 31.9% of all married women (aged 18 to 49) report facing domestic violence (emotional, physical, or sexual) by their spouse."

#### Response

[Here](/nfhs-one-sided){:target="_blank"} it is. 

**TLDR:** NFHS is a one-sided survey sponsored by foreign elements interested in showing Indian men as wife-beaters.

### Now, what do we do?

Don't allow them to edit their article now.

2. Anyone who uses NCRB, NFHS, UNODC data to discredit men's rights - They deserve to be slapped with this thread.  Do the honours!

3. Take some time to read through the statistics from NCRB to see how deep the problem is for Indian men.

4. Show men some love ‚ù£Ô∏è
