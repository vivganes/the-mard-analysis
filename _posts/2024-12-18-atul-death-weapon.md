You must have seen feminists (smugly) quoting a The Print India article titled "Atul Subhash death is a weapon for men‚Äôs rights activists. They don‚Äôt care about men‚Äôs lives"

## Meet the Wolf

Did you know that this piece is a foreign toolkit attack targeting Indian population?

In fact, this article is a brilliant example of wolf acting like it cares for the lamb, only to devour it later.

Let us dive into the main claims of this article and see if the wolf REALLY cares for the lamb.

## Claims - Debunked

### Claim 1

> In a country where 20 women die everyday in dowry-related incidents, murder and suicide, the death of a man is an outlier.

From the link given in article, we see that this data is for year 2019.

```2019 - 20 women die per day -> 0.83 women per hour -> 1 woman every 72 minutes```

Here, the "20 women" focuses on murder _and_ suicide.  

Let's compare that number with _just_ the suicides of men, that too 'married' men only. 

(Source: [https://ncrb.gov.in/uploads/2022/July/11/custom/adsi/sii-table-2.8_2019.pdf](https://ncrb.gov.in/uploads/2022/July/11/custom/adsi/sii-table-2.8_2019.pdf){:target="_blank"})

`2019 - 66815 married male suicides -> 7.62 men per hour -> 1 man every 7.86 minutes`

The situation has gravely worsened in 2022. 

(Source: [https://ncrb.gov.in/uploads/nationalcrimerecordsbureau/custom/1702020697Table29state-ut.pdf](https://ncrb.gov.in/uploads/nationalcrimerecordsbureau/custom/1702020697Table29state-ut.pdf){:target="_blank"} )

`2022 - 83713 suicides -> 9.56 men per hour -> 1 man every 6.27 minutes`

Now, let's come to the **OUTLIER** claim. 

For something to be an **OUTLIER**, it needs to be rare.  

Married men's suicide is 10 times more frequent than women's death as per the official data above. How can it be an outlier?

By the way, _no one_ is interested in knowing why a married man kills himself every 6 minutes.

### Claim 2

> ... the death of a man is an outlier, and therefore, a gift to media outlets starved for novelty.

We already saw that the death of a man is not an outlier.

Also, it is not novel (a new thing).  

In fact, there were many other men who committed suicide under very similar circumstances.  (Google Syed Makhdoom, Sandeep Paswan, etc.)

In the past instances, the media outlets did not cover those cases with this seriousness.

This time, the media is covering probably because the common public is outraged.

### Claim 3

> Subhash has been transformed from a man in crisis into a martyr for a particular cause

Subhash transformed _himself_ into a martyr, no one else did.  

He did that because he had **no** other choice.  I suspect feminists like the author might have had a huge part to play in that lack of choice.

This is very evident in his suicide note, letter to judiciary and the hour long video.

### Claim 4

> We now have men ... calling for the return of Khap panchayats ... Manusmriti... look for 'prenups' ... demanding dowry be made legal ... they want women to be forced to carry children and beaten ...

This week, the popular feminist mantra is _"Just because of a few fake case extortionists, we cannot generalize all women."_

Why don't you apply the same argument to the men you see on the internet?

Equality, much?

### Claim 5

> Almost on cue, the Avengers assembled. The men‚Äôs rights activists, the anti-Section 498-ers, the trad-wife fantasists, and the garden variety Right-wing misogynists, all formed an anguished overnight coalition.

Not just MRAs, people from all walks of life came in support of [#JusticeIsDue](https://x.com/search?q=%23JusticeIsDue&src=typed_query){:target="_blank"} because they could relate to Atul. 

I am sure most of them did not even know the term MRA when they came out in support.

They were just tired of someone tormented by fake cases in their family or friends circle.

See the conversations [here](https://x.com/Vivek_Ganesan/status/1867749080660947161){:target="_blank"} if you don't believe me.

### Claim 6

> ... brotherhood that awakens only when male pain can be transformed into ammunition against women‚Äôs rights

No one is talking about taking away women's rights.

a. We are talking about making sure men have rights too.

b. We are talking about treating the mother-in-law also as a woman, which you don't seem to care about.  For you, only the wife is the woman, right?

c. We are talking about addressing systemic corruption.

d. Most importantly, we are talking about holding the fake caser extortionists accountable.

Why don't you also talk about these things, if you care so much about men?  

Or, is your concern as fake as it sounds?

### Claim 7

> According to the National Family Health Survey, blah blah blah

NFHS is a one-sided study that provokes women to think about domestic violence while remaining silent on domestic violence against men.

Its one-sidedness is a feature, not a bug. [I am talking the language of Bill Gates, if you know what I mean üòú]

If you have not been taught about these in your 'equalist' school, read [this](https://www.themardanalysis.com/nfhs-one-sided/)

### Claim 8

> The world over, home is the unsafest place for women.

The link in the article leads us to the UN Femicides report, which is based on the data from [here](https://dataunodc.un.org/dp-intentional-homicide-victims)

This page does not have India in the countries list.  [See pic üëá]

![Screenshot showing that there is no data about India](/assets/images/blogs/wolf-lamb-weapon/no-india-data.png)

This data is irrelevant to India. 

Why are you desperate to insert irrelevant data to prove something that doesn't exist?

### Claim 9

> According to this report, 'It is often claimed that ... '

[Here](https://x.com/Vivek_Ganesan/status/1868713235299574047){:target="_blank"} is another analysis debunking your source report.

Also, what's up in your feminist group with this cross-citing each other's baseless articles to add fake credibility? Huh?

### Claim 10

> When over 30 per cent of male suicides stem from family problems unrelated to marriage, where are the passionate calls for mental health support?

We are not living in joint families anymore.  In fact, as per the recent data from Ministry of Statistics and Program Implementation, average household has 4.2 people. See screenshot üëá

![Graph showing household size of 4.2](/assets/images/blogs/wolf-lamb-weapon/household-size.png)

So, most family problems have a spouse angle to them.  So, when a man kills himself due to family problems, his spouse probably has at least some contribution to it.

And, if only a man can open up about his problems to his wife, why would we need mental health support?

Also, who said MRAs don't talk about mental health support?  Men's communities are the most visible features of MRA movement.

Finally, Atul does not fit the category of people who need mental health support.  He was calm enough to execute his suicide plan clinically.

### BONUS: Incoherent Rambling 

> What‚Äôs killing Indian men?

You have written a few paragraphs as if you know what's killing Indian men.  

We don't know the answer at all as we don't collect such data about men's issues.

In fact, your favourite NFHS (National Family Health Survey) does not allow us to collect data about Domestic violence on men.

In fact, your favourite DV act is titled "Protection of Women from Domestic Violence Act, 2005".  Why not protect men also?

If only you had real concern and knowledge about what's killing men, 

  a. you would have supported adding men's data in NFHS

  b. you would have opposed protecting only women from DV

  c. you would have shut up and asked men "What's wrong?" instead of spewing 6 paras of verbal diarrhea under the heading "What‚Äôs killing Indian men?"

You didn't do them, did you?

You are the wolf showing fake concern on the lamb.

## Now, what do we do?

1.  Bookmark [this link](https://web.archive.org/web/20241217154626/https://theprint.in/opinion/atul-subhash-death-weapon-mens-rights-activists-dont-care-mens-lives/2406250/)  - This is an archive (dot) org snapshot of today. Don't allow them to edit their article now.

2. Anyone who uses NCRB, NFHS, UNODC data to discredit men's rights - They deserve to be slapped with this thread.  Do the honours!

3. Ask men in your life, "What's wrong?" without judging them.  They may not tell you right away.  But, eventually, they might.

4. Show men some love ‚ù£Ô∏è

Peace ‚úåÔ∏è
